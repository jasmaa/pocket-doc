Lacerations: 

    Apply direct pressure on the area. Remove any clothing or debris on the wound. Don't remove large or deeply embedded objects. First stop
    the bleeding with firm pressure, not on sensitive areas like eyes. Clean the area with warm water and gentle soap.
    and/or apply antibiotic ointment, then put a sterile bandage on the area and apply more as necessary.
    Be especially aware of deep puncture wounds or bites (animals or human).

Bruising:

    (RICE)
    Rest the bruised area, if possible.
    Ice the bruise with an ice pack wrapped in a towel. Leave it in place for 10 to 20 minutes. Repeat several times a day for a day or two as needed.
    Compress the bruised area if it is swelling, using an elastic bandage. Don't make it too tight.
    Elevate the injured area.

Rashes:

    Wash the rash with mild soap but don't scrub. Rinse with warm water.
    Pat the skin dry, rather than rubbing it.
    Don't cover the rash.
    Medicine like Zinc oxide ointment, Calamine lotion or for severe itching, applying hydrocortisone cream, are very effective.
